env file contains the individual user environment variables that override the variables set 
in the /etc/environment file. You can customize your environment variables as desired by 
modifying your . env file.
- [x]4 Set-up connection PDO:
PDO will work on 12 different database systems and is object-oriented.  It also supports
Prepared Statements. Prepared Statements protect from SQL injection, and are very important 
for web application security.  If you have to switch your project to use another database, 
PDO makes the process easy. You only have to change the connection string and a few queries.
